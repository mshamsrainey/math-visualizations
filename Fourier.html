    <h1>Using a Fourier Series to Approximate a Square Wave</h1>
    <p>Taylor Series approximation of a function f(x) is only applicable when the function is differentiable. Fourier series are particularly useful for functions which are not differentiable or which are k-periodic (repeating over a period such that for the function f(x) f(x + k) = f(x) for all x.)</p>
